# Twilight PVE Radar

A feature-rich DMA-based radar for Escape from Tarkov, forked from [Lone EFT DMA Radar](https://github.com/lone-dma/Lone-EFT-DMA-Radar) with additional enhancements.

**Note:** This project is primarily developed and tested for **PVE mode**. Most features should work in PVP as well, but PVP compatibility is not actively tested.

## Features

### Radar & Tracking
- Real-time player tracking with team/group detection
- PMC, Scav, Boss, and Raider identification
- Player gear value estimation
- Corpse and death marker tracking
- Exfil point display with status indicators
- Quest location markers and objective tracking
- Hazard zone visualization (minefields, sniper zones)

### Loot System
- Loose loot scanning with price filtering
- Container contents scanning (PVE/Offline)
- Custom loot filters with color coding
- Quest item highlighting
- Hideout upgrade item tracking
- Corpse loot inspection

### Widgets & UI
- Aimview widget with configurable FOV
- Player info widget (health, gear, distance)
- Freelook mode with smooth panning
- Multi-map support with auto-detection
- Configurable draw distances and entity visibility
- Modular floating panel UI with drag, resize, and collapse
- Auto-collapsing sidebar navigation
- SkiaSharp-powered radar rendering

### ESP & Overlay
- DX9 Fuser overlay with mini-radar
- Box ESP, skeleton ESP, distance markers
- Health bars and player names
- Loot ESP with filtering

### Memory Features
- Device aimbot (KMBox support)
- Silent aim
- No recoil / no sway
- Infinite stamina
- Thermal/NVG toggle
- Loot through walls

*Memory write features are from the original Moulman fork and have not been tested by the current maintainer.*

### Web Radar
- Remote web-based radar access
- Real-time data streaming
- Mobile-friendly interface

### Local Mesh LOS (Line-of-Sight)
- Per-bone visibility detection using exported collision meshes — no in-game plugin needed at runtime
- Dual-mode raycasting: eye LOS (includes foliage) and ballistic LOS (no foliage)
- BVH-accelerated raycasting on a dedicated T5 worker thread (~8ms per frame, up to 64 enemies x 18 bones)
- Three-tier mesh loading: `.bvhcache` (instant) → `.tmesh` (binary) → `.obj` (text fallback)
- Reactive scene management: unused meshes auto-unload on mode toggle to save RAM
- Per-bone ESP coloring based on visibility results

#### MapData Setup

The radar auto-creates the folder structure on startup. Export meshes using the [CollisionExporter](../CollisionExporter/) plugin (press F9 in-raid), then copy the map folder to `MapData/`:

```
Radar/
  MapData/
    Customs/
      LOS/
        <any .tmesh or .obj file>       # Eye LOS mesh (includes foliage)
        <auto-generated .bvhcache>      # BVH cache (created on first load)
      Ballistics/
        <any .tmesh or .obj file>       # Ballistic mesh (no foliage)
        <auto-generated .bvhcache>
    Factory/
      LOS/
      Ballistics/
    ...
```

File names don't matter — the radar picks up the first `.tmesh` (or `.obj`) it finds in each subfolder. First load builds a BVH and caches it; subsequent loads are instant.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 (tested on 23H2/25H2)
- DMA hardware (FPGA-based)
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- 1920x1080 resolution recommended

## Common Issues

### DX Overlay/D3DX Errors

If you see errors like:
```
DX overlay init failed
ESP DX init failed: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'd3dx943.dll'
```

**Fix:** Download and install the [DirectX End-User Runtime (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) from Microsoft.

Do **not** download DLL files from third-party sites.

### Performance Issues

Running both radar and fuser overlay simultaneously may impact performance on lower-end hardware. Consider disabling the overlay if experiencing issues.

## Building

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

Output will be in `bin/Release/net8.0-windows/`
